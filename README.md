# Mechanical-Ventilator
This repo contains cad files and codes for pressure control loop based 3D printable, quick deploy mechanical ventilator 


***Caution :This design is work in progress..***


**STL** files will be available soon..along with **circuit diagram** and **Code**

This design uses specially designed joint in which a **Baromatric Pressure** sensor can be inserted to monitor pressure on patients air capilories 

using **nema 17** and combination of **reduction gear** precice movement and airflow can be maintained 

For faster processing **Teensy 4.0** will be used instid of **Arduino uno**
